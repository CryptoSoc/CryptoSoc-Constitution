# The Cryptocurrency and Artificial Intelligence Society

The purpose of this society is to raise awareness and educate people about the new opportunities and potential of specific advanced technologies: artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency and blockchain. Moreover, the aim of the society is not to purely focus on the technical aspects and challenges of such technology but rather wishes to incorporate other fields into this technology. Economics, healthcare, art and many other fields can be influenced by these topics in a profound way. Leaving anybody behind because traditional leaders are too focused on the technical aspects is exclusionary and unfair. We are promoting open access to advanced technologies from around the world and encourage collaboration between creators, designers and dreamers. 


Specifically, we aim to educate our members about:
-	Technical implementations of these technologies.
-	Philosophical prospects of decentralized networks and artificial intelligence.
-	Specific applications to various fields, such as healthcare, finance, computing, and more.
-	Innovation in these spaces.
-	Future opportunities, such as projects and careers.

The society, as an academic interest society, will expose students and staff to a rapidly evolving world of technology. Currently we are at the beginning of a new era. Similar to the information age, there is massive promise in distributing knowledge to innovate in tech fields.
 
We promote openness and transparency, efficiency, personal privacy and innovation.


## Q&A
 
1.	Does the developers' society not encompass an "AI and Cryptocurrency" society?

The developers' society focuses on providing for programmers. Our society aims to cater for a more general audience that does not necessarily need the technical know-how to get involved in big projects that can change the world. CryptoSoc aims to harness the collective thinking that many different fields will produce when combined with ground-breaking tech. 
 
2.	Isn't cryptocurrency/bitcoin a scam?

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole are generally poorly understood. By analogy, when email was created, why couldn't post offices see that it would take the world by storm? People get comfortable with what they are using already. But at university, don’t we encourage lateral thinking? Thinking that challenges the status quo. If you aren't willing to try learn about something new then why should we try learn anything at all?

3.	Is cryptocurrency in a bubble?

Perhaps… But the question you must ask yourself is does it matter? Or rather does technology like cryptocurrencies and blockchain being in a slight financial bubble now mean that it won’t be used extensively in the future?  I liken the situation to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990’s where speculation and overfunding lead to an overvaluation of the early Internet companies and subsequently a crash. Despite all this some major companies such as eBay, Amazon ,Paypal (and many others) are still very successful today and the internet is still, undoubtedly, a fundamentally important technology in our time. So just because there “might” be a few too many spectators in the market does that mean we should rule out cryptocurrencies? I think not.

4.	Is artificial intelligence actually a technology that will benefit the average human?

Many people argue against supporting technologies like artificial intelligence on the basis that this kind of technology will make many jobs in the future redundant. They say supporting such tech is supporting the loss of jobs. While this may be true in some respects - many jobs will likely become redundant- people forget that the technology, like all technology, is made to make human life easier. Technologies varying from the likes of the cotton wheel to email have displaced many jobs in the textile industry and the post office - But they have also made clothes and communication cheaper and accessible to the everyday person. Artificial intelligence is very likely to be similar and in fact could open up an array of new job opportunities where human beings and computers do jobs and solve problems that we could not do by ourselves.


## Potential Benefits and Education Opportunities

Artificial Intelligence |	Cryptocurrency

The general benefit of artificial intelligence, or AI, is that it replicates decisions and actions of humans without human shortcomings, such as fatigue, emotion and limited time [1]. Artificial intelligence can help solve some of the world’s most difficult problems. |	By eliminating third party intermediaries and overhead costs for exchanging assets, blockchains have the potential to greatly reduce transaction fees [2] and create an easily accessible global marketplace.
Artificial intelligence and the science of robotics can be put to use in mining and other dangerous jobs. |	Users are in control of all their information and transactions.
Artificial intelligence helps us in reducing the error and perform routine tasks uniformly, particularly in applications where mistakes are a matter of life or death. |	Due to the decentralized networks, blockchain does not have a central point of failure and is better able to withstand malicious attacks.
Artificial intelligence has the potential to improve people’s lives. It may help humanity improve and survive some of the challenges that we currently and eventually will face. |	Users can trust that transactions will be executed exactly as the protocol commands removing the need for a trusted third party and reducing the likelihood of fraud.
In the medical field also, we will find the wide application of AI. Already doctors across the world are using machine learning and AI principles to improve diagnosis and treatment for a variety of diseases and disorders - from cancer to schizophrenia. | Changes to public blockchains are publicly viewable by all parties creating transparency, and all transactions are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered or deleted. This can help reduce corruption and money laundering.
AI is a field that has massive applications and the biggest companies in the world are investing heavily into it. Companies like IBM, Google, Apple and Facebook (just to name a few) have already spent millions of dollars trying to develop their own AI products.	| Interbank transactions can potentially take days for clearing and final settlement, especially outside of working hours. Blockchain transactions can reduce transaction times to minutes and are processed 24/7.
